This feels a bit like posting to social media because this is public and therefore I feel a bit filtered (no #), BUT THAT BEING SAID: 
This week has been a small whirlwind as these concepts are very new to me, even just saying "commit changes" instead of "submit" feels so different... 
I had a hard time joining github because of Captcha issues. Again and again (despite trying different browsers, emails, incognito, etc.) it would either say my answers were incorrect OR it would say it accepted it, but then direct me right back to the signup/troubleshooting page. 
At first it gave me 10 puzzle questions but then it switched to 1-3, and every time the question was the same - even on different browsers, but still didn't work.
Turns out, I already had a github back from my LIBRARY CODING DAYS! My username HAD TO BE CHANGED STAT but thanks to past me I am happy to report I am here finally.
Using p5.js is already proving to be interesting, there's a sense of "oh, this could be creatively great, even soothing, I'm excited!" and "OH.NO.OHNO.OHNOOHNOOHNO!!!!!" going on for me at the moment.
I'm SO glad we're using something like p5.js to jump into this.
I'm looking forward to experimenting more with p5.js and to next class!
