This week I felt a bit more comfortable with things like making shapes. I feel like I'm just starting to touch the alphabet - not sure what so many
of the letters mean, or how to recall them again even once I have seen what they mean (do) in action, 
but I'm trying to let the process be what it is and not expect to understand already what I do not yet know or am only starting to
visualize.

One thing I'm working on is the way that works best for me to organize and recall information.
Since this feels like learning a language, I need to figure out
what kind of structure works best for me.

Overall, I feel like I know more than I did last week.


Notes:


“In reality, tools and resources alone cannot be democratic.” (p. 57, processing manual) - this makes sense because once they exist
they exist in the world that surrounds them, shaped by the systems they exist in, shaped by those who exist in the systems that they themselves
exist in...

"No one likes to be criticized, but everyone
loves to be understood."(p.58, processing manual) - this stands out to me as being so central to so much in the work that I do and
the things I engage with that matter to me.

Scope = scope of a project, managing scope, how many things do you do, etc.
also, what parts of the program have access to the program. 

let, const = set a variable 
older tutorials: var
// at beginning of a line comments it out, so it doesn’t run (aka like a way to add a comment)

you can store numbers in variables (integers = whole, floats = decimals)
strings are text that is surrounded by quotes (“shoe”)
array = a list of things surrounded by brackets 

[ ] means there is a list

main type you work with in p5.js is an object, which use {}

in HSB vs. RGB mode, you can change the color in a dynamic way without changing how bright or saturated the color is

properties can be words, values can be any other thing

Questions:
what does webGL mean again?
